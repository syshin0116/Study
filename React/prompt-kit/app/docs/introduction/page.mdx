**prompt-kit** is a set of customizable, high-quality components built for AI applications, making it easy to design chat experiences, AI agents, autonomous assistants, and more, quickly and beautifully.

**prompt-kit** is built on top of shadcn/ui with the same design principles. But instead of helping you build a component library, it helps you build AI interfaces.

This project is a work in progress, and we're continuously improving and expanding the collection. We'd love to hear your feedback or see your contributions as it evolves!

prompt-kit is open source. Check out the code and contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/ibelick/prompt-kit).
