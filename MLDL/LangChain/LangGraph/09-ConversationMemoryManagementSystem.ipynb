    "### Short Term Memory\n",
    "Short-term memory lets your application remember previous interactions within a single thread or conversation. A thread organizes multiple interactions in a session, similar to the way email groups messages in a single conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph manages short-term memory as part of the agent's state, persisted via thread-scoped checkpoints. This state can normally include the conversation history along with other stateful data, such as uploaded files, retrieved documents, or generated artifacts. By storing these in the graph's state, the bot can access the full context for a given conversation while maintaining separation between different threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since conversation history is the most common form of representing short-term memory, in the next section, we will cover techniques for managing conversation history when the list of messages becomes long. If you want to stick to the high-level concepts, continue on to the long-term memory section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Long Term Memory\n",
    "Long-term memory is shared across conversational threads. It can be recalled at any time and in any thread. Memories are scoped to any custom namespace, not just within a single thread ID. LangGraph provides stores (reference doc) to let you save and recall long-term memories.\n",
